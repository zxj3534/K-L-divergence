# K-L-divergence
results.pdf contains the K-L divergences between the LLR distributions obtained by BP decoding and MAP decoding of variable nodes in ten different structures. These results indicate that variables nodes involved in shorter and more numerous cycles tend to have larger K-L divergences. The distance between BP decoding and MAP decoding is greater.
